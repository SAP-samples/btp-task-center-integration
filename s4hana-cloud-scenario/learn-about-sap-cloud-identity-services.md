## Introduction

SAP Cloud Identity Services are needed for integrating task providers with SAP Task Center.

The SAP Cloud Identity Services comprise the Identity Authentication services (IAS) and Identity Provisioning services (IPS).
You will need to ensure that they are connected to your task provider (they have already been connected to SAP Task Center, as explained in one of the previous cards, referring to this mission).

- SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Provisioning [(link to the SAP Help documentation)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/IDENTITY_PROVISIONING/)
 
SAP Task Center is a service which requires the use of the user UUID as a common user identifier. This attribute is automatically generated by Identity Authentication at user creation. It can be provisioned to various SAP cloud solutions by Identity Provisioning.
