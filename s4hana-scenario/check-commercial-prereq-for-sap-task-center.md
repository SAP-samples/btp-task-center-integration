## Prerequisite

SAP Task Center is available using Free Tier, Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (**CPEA**) and Pay-As-You-Go. Please ensure that your SAP Business Technology Platform account belongs to one of these commercial models.


## Get Started with Free Tier

As an SAP user with an existing CPEA or PAYG for SAP BTP contract, you can simply [log into your SAP BTP cockpit](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome) to get started.

If you don’t have a global account in SAP BTP and want to get started using the free tier, sign up for a PAYG account on the SAP Store.

Take a look at this [blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/11/16/btp-free-trial-to-free-tier-its-a-good-time-to-switch/) or complete [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html) to get more insights on the sign up process.


 ## Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP

Sign up to start using cloud services in your production environment with no upfront cost, no minimum usage requirements, and no financial commitments.

The contract auto-renews every three months with monthly billing and can be upgraded to a Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (CPEA).

## Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (CPEA)

This model allows for the consumption of cloud credits based on actual usage with the highest flexibility.

With just one contract, you can get access to all services available under CPEA and configure them in your global account. This includes new features available after the contract signing date. Consume services based on project requirements, without having to change your contract, and only get charged for what is used.

Contact your SAP sales representative for more information.
