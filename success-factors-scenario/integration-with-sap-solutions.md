## Introduction
The described mission covers only the basic setup for SAP Task Center on SAP Business Technology Platform.

To make use of SAP Task Center as a truly central inbox for the supported SAP solutions, you need to adapt the destinations created by the booster to connect to the task provider systems that you want to use. Please have a closer look on the [offical documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/TASK_CENTER/08cbda59b4954e93abb2ec85f1db399d/34707338cdf94faa9ff2a684b16a8a5f.html?version=Cloud) which scenarios are supported. 

In addition to this basic mission, we'll offer subsequent missions for the task provider systems.
